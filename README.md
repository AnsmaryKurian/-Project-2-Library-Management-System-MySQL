# Library-Management-System
  The provided SQL program establishes a comprehensive Library Management System by creating a database named library and defining six key tables: Branch, Employee, Books, Customer, IssueStatus, and ReturnStatus. Each table includes attributes pertinent to their respective entities, with primary keys ensuring unique identification and foreign keys maintaining referential integrity between tables. For example, the Employee table references the Branch table to indicate the branch each employee works in, while the IssueStatus and ReturnStatus tables link to both Customer and Books tables to track the issuance and return of books.
  Following the database setup, various SQL queries are provided to extract valuable information from the library system. These queries range from listing available books and their details to retrieving customer information and book issuance history. Specific tasks include sorting employee salaries, counting books in each category, identifying customers who registered before a certain date and haven't issued any books, and finding employees managing branches. This program ensures that all crucial aspects of library management, such as book availability, employee details, customer transactions, and branch operations, are efficiently tracked and retrievable for administrative and operational purposes.
